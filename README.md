# Wine-Quality-Prediction

Red wine has been part of social, religious, and cultural events for hundreds of years. Medieval monasteries believed that their monks lived longer partly because of their regular, moderate drinking of wine.

Red wine is made by crushing and fermenting dark-colored, whole grapes.

There are many types of red wine, which vary in taste and color. Common varieties include Shiraz, Merlot, Cabernet sauvignon, Pinot noir and Zinfandel.

The alcohol content usually ranges from 12–15%.

According to a 2018 study, although notably there are no official recommendations around these benefits, drinking red wine in moderation has positive links with:

* cardiovascular disease
* atherosclerosis
* hypertension
* certain types of cancer
* type 2 diabetes
* neurological disorders
* metabolic syndrome

Dataset features detail:
* **Fixed Acidity**: are non-volatile acids that do not evaporate readily
* **Volatile Acidity**: are high acetic acid in wine which leads to an unpleasant vinegar taste
* **Citric Acid**: acts as a preservative to increase acidity. When in small quantities, adds freshness and flavor to wines
* **Residual Sugar**: is the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops. The key is to have a perfect balance between sweetness and sourness. It is important to note that wines > 45g/ltrs are sweet
* **Chlorides**: the amount of salt in the wine
* **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
* **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: is the amount of free + bound forms of SO2
* **Density**: sweeter wines have a higher density
* **pH**: describes the level of acidity on a scale of 0–14. Most wines are always between 3–4 on the pH scale
* **Alcohol**: available in small quantities in wines makes the drinkers sociable
* **Sulphates**: a wine additive that contributes to SO2 levels and acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
* **Quality**: which is the output variable/predictor
